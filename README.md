Welcome to [women.code(be)](http://bit.ly/wdcb-website), a community for womxn who code in Belgium. 🇧🇪

Together, we aim to make a positive impact on diversity in our Belgian tech scene (this includes companies as well as other communities).
Some of our initiatives involve regular womxn-only as well as occasional inclusive meet-ups with guest speakers, creating public speaking opportunities, opportunities to network with fellow peers and so on... With these events we hope to create a safe space where local womxn who code can connect with fellow peers.
